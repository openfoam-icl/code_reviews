Code reviews, tips and tricks

Imperial College OpenFOAM Research Software Community 

We started a weekly meeting where we discuss about OpenFOAM, numerical methods,
modelling and good programming practice.

The history of our reviews is public and all the minutes can be accessed
through our [Google Drive Code Reviews Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jaWUxBVbzJ7u2zq4Rc8kH2H3anyJQv78?usp=sharing)

The community is open to everyone inside and outside Imperial College, and we are happy to learn and share insight!

If you want to join our code review sessions, email f.huerta-perez17@imperial.ac.uk who will arrange your attendance
depending on how busy the session will be. Feel free to interact in the Issues section!

Imperial College OpenFOAM Research Software Community code reviews, tips and tricks

We started a weekly meeting where we discuss about OpenFOAM, numerical methods,
modelling and good programming practice.

Frequency: Weekly on Mondays, 4.30 pm - 5.30pm.
Scope: (OpenFOAM / Physical Modelling / Implementation / Numerical Methods)

The history of our reviews is public and all the minutes can be accessed
through our [Google Drive Code Reviews Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jaWUxBVbzJ7u2zq4Rc8kH2H3anyJQv78?usp=sharing)

The community is open to everyone inside and outside Imperial College, and we are happy to learn and share insight!
